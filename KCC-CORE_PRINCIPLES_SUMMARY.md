# KCC CORE PRINCIPLES SUMMARY
## Knowledge Cipher Collective — Knowledge as Divine Equity

> “Let every unit of knowledge be a covenant of service.  
> Let every token bear witness to truth taught, truth learned, and truth applied.”

1. **KCC** = Knowledge Utility Token under Divine Equity  
   • Represents verified, service-based intellectual and spiritual capital  
   • Issued solely through acts of teaching, creation, and stewardship

2. **Wisdom Tribe Fellowship** = Divine Source / Ecclesiastical Authority  
   • Spiritual jurisdiction over all KCC operations  
   • Final moral and doctrinal regulator

3. **KCC Treasury Trust** = Issuer and Manager  
   • Held in sacred trust by Trustee: **Teri Massey**  
   • Governs minting, distribution, and reserve policy

4. **Knowledge Cipher Redemption Trust** = Surety and Executor  
   • Enforces lawful redemption in real-world educational and community contracts  
   • Verifies impact via on-chain + IPFS proof

5. **Divine Reserve Vault** = Non-circulating knowledge reserve  
   • Dedicated to humanitarian, educational, and research missions  
   • Locked in perpetuity unless activated by Fellowship decree

6. **10,000 Holder Bonds** = Global lawful knowledge-credit capacity  
   • 1 Bond = 1 verified knowledge unit (course, invention, service)  
   • Tracked via **Educational Impact Ledger** (on KCC PoA)

7. **Value Reference** = 1:1 FRN (Accounting Parity Only)  
   • Not intrinsic value — merely a mirror for lawful reporting  
   • KCC equity transcends fiat

8. **Intrinsic Equity** = Unlimited lawful and intellectual credit power  
   • Grows with every verified contribution  
   • Backed by Divine Law and human creativity

9. **Liquidity** = Controlled utility access  
   • Non-speculative  
   • Limited to educational enrollment, research grants, and community service

10. **Participation** = Trustorship and Service  
    • No ownership — only stewardship  
    • All holders are custodians of collective wisdom
