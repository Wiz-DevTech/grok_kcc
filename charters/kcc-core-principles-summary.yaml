interpretive_principle: |
  KCC treats “knowledge as equity.”  
  Its ecosystem functions as a moral economy where teaching, invention, and shared intelligence  
  are treated as redeemable acts of service — recorded and verified through the trust framework.

    1. **KCC** = Knowledge Utility Token under Divine Equity  
       • Represents verified, service-based intellectual and spiritual capital  
       • Issued solely through acts of teaching, creation, and stewardship

    2. **Wisdom Tribe Fellowship** = Divine Source / Ecclesiastical Authority  
       • Spiritual jurisdiction over all KCC operations  
       • Final moral and doctrinal regulator

    3. **KCC Treasury Trust** = Issuer and Manager  
       • Held in sacred trust by Trustee: **Teri Massey**  
       • Governs minting, distribution, and reserve policy

    4. **Knowledge Cipher Redemption Trust** = Surety and Executor  
       • Enforces lawful redemption in real-world educational and community contracts  
       • Verifies impact via on-chain + IPFS proof

    5. **Divine Reserve Vault** = Non-circulating knowledge reserve  
       • Dedicated to humanitarian, educational, and research missions  
       • Locked in perpetuity unless activated by Fellowship decree

    6. **10,000 Holder Bonds** = Global lawful knowledge-credit capacity  
       • 1 Bond = 1 verified knowledge unit (course, invention, service)  
       • Tracked via **Educational Impact Ledger** (on KCC PoA)

    7. **Value Reference** = 1:1 FRN (Accounting Parity Only)  
       • Not intrinsic value — merely a mirror for lawful reporting  
       • KCC equity transcends fiat

    8. **Intrinsic Equity** = Unlimited lawful and intellectual credit power  
       • Grows with every verified contribution  
       • Backed by Divine Law and human creativity

    9. **Liquidity** = Controlled utility access  
       • Non-speculative  
       • Limited to educational enrollment, research grants, and community service

   10. **Participation** = Trustorship and Service  
       • No ownership — only stewardship  
       • All holders are custodians of collective wisdom
