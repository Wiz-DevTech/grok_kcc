interpretive_principle: |
  Where SHC represents Service as Wealth, KCC represents **Foundation as Equity**.  
  Each KCC token reflects a living foundation—a lawful pillar of creation, education, and infrastructure.  
  Ownership is replaced by stewardship; speculation replaced by stability; and profit replaced by purpose.  
  The Treasury Trust and Redemption Trust act as the lawful balance between divine intent and human activity,  
  ensuring all expansion remains within spiritual law and lawful governance.
