title: "FOUNDATION-EQUITY PRINCIPLES AND LEDGER UTILITY OF KCC"
subtitle: "Why KCC, Like XRP, Requires No External Backing"
status: "CANON APPROVED"
date_issued: "2025"

preamble: |
  When Ripple Labs created XRP, it was not “backed” by U.S. dollars or any external commodity.  
  Its value emerged from **utility**—the integrity of the ledger, the efficiency of the consensus model,  
  and the trust inherent in a functioning system.  
  The same principle applies to **KCC (Knowledge Cipher Collective)**.  
  **Backing is what a promise requires. Utility is what a functioning system demonstrates.**

core_principle: |
  KCC does not promise redemption in another currency—  
  **it performs redemption in action through its Foundation-Equity Framework.**  
  Its intrinsic value is embedded in the living system itself.
